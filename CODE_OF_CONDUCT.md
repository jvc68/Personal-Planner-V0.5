# Code of Conduct

The Iron Man Planner team is committed to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment for all contributors to the project and memeber of our community. To ensure that everyone has a positive experience, we ask that all contributors adhere to the following code of conduct.

## Our Pledge

We, as members, contributors, and leaders, pledge to make participation in our project a harassment-free and positive experience for everyone.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contribute to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and friendly language
- Being respectful of other users viewpoints and experiences
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing kindness to your fellow community members
- Being accepting towards constructive criticism

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- Public or private harassment
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement

Instances of unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project maintainers. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. Maintainers are obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and it also applies when an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces. Examples of representing our project or community include using an official project email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Project maintainers will follow these guidelines when enforcing the Code of Conduct:

1. **Correction**: Any participant who is found to be in violation of the Code of Conduct will be given a warning or other corrective action. This could include anything from a reminder of the Code of Conduct to a temporary ban from the project or its community spaces.

2. **Temporary Ban**: If a participant's behavior is harmful or disruptive, they may be temporarily banned from project-related spaces or events. This will be determined on a case-by-case basis.

3. **Permanent Ban**: In extreme cases of violation or if the participant's behavior does not improve after corrective actions, a permanent ban may be enforced.
