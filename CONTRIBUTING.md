## How to Contribute

### 1. **Fork the repository**

Start by forking the repository to your own GitHub account. This will create a copy of the repository under your account where you can make changes.

- Navigate to the repository on GitHub.
- Click the "Fork" button in the upper-right corner of the page.
- Choose your account as the destination for the fork.

### 2. **Clone your fork**

Once you have forked the repository, clone it to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Personal-Planner.git
```

Replace `your-username` with your GitHub username.

### 3. **Navigate to the project directory**

After cloning, change to the project directory:

```bash
cd Personal-Planner
```

### 4. **Create a new branch**

Create a new branch to work on your changes. This keeps your changes separate from the `main` branch:

```bash
git checkout -b feature-name
```

Choose a descriptive name for your branch, such as naming it after the new feature you are implementing or a bug you are fixing.

### 5. **Make your changes**

Now you can make your changes! Be sure to follow the coding conventions used in the project. If you're adding a feature or fixing a bug, write your code accordingly.

### 6. **Test your changes**

Ensure your changes work as expected by running the project locally and testing the functionality.

### 7. **Commit your changes**

Once you're happy with your changes, commit them with a clear and concise commit message. For example:

```bash
git commit -am 'Add new task creation functionality'
```

### 8. **Push to your fork**

After committing your changes, push your branch to your forked repository:

```bash
git push origin feature-name
```

### 9. **Open a pull request**

Go to your forked repository on GitHub and click the "Compare & pull request" button. Provide a description of what your pull request does, and submit it.
