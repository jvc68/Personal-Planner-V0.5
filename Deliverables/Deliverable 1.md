# 1. Introduction
Describe in one paragraph what your project is about. Make it clear what problem your software is solving and the context of the solution.

We are aiming to solve the problem of having to download multiple apps for workout, meal tracking, and personal planning. Our product solves this problem by being a one-stop shop for all of these services. One website where you can track your calories, plan workouts, and handle personal scheduling. Extra features like being able to calculate what your ideal daily calorie intake is makes our website the perfect place for any health-focused person to centralize all their life planning.

# 2. Initial value proposition and customer segments
Report the initial guesses for the (i) value proposition and (ii) customer segment. The value proposition should make clear what your product is, the target customer, the value you provide, and why your product is unique. See examples on the lecture slides.

## Value Proposition

- **Product**: An all-in-one website that allows customers to plan workouts, track meals, and plan in a calendar.
- **Target Customer**: People who are interested in organizing their lives around health and being heavily regimented.
- **Value Provided**: We aim to make a feature-rich website all packaged into one page, making it the only service you need.
- **What makes it Unique**: Our unique feature is a BMI calculator that can decide how many calories you should be eating in a given day.

## Customer Segment

People who are sick of using multiple applications for different parts of their health-focused lifestyle. These people are extremely disciplined when it comes to monitoring diet and exercise.

**Grading criteria (5 points)**: The value proposition should make clear the value from the point of view of the customer. It should not be a slogan or a description of functionality. The value proposition and consumer segment should be coherent with the text in the previous section---in particular, the value should address the problem reported above (problem-solution fit). The customer segment should not be too broad or too specific.

# 3. Interviews summary
Present the results of each interview (the minimum number of interviews is 1.5 * the number of participants in the group). You should have at least 5 questions per interview that relate to your problem and the potential value your product provides.

For each interview, report:
- **Who was interviewed and who participated in the interview**
- **When**
- **Customer segment**
- **Key insights from the interview**
- **Representative quotes**
- **Assessment**: Must have / Nice to have / Don’t care (how the interviewee sees the solution)
